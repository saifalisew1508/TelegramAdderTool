## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (Q&A)

### Q: Why can’t I just use a proxy to avoid bans?
**A:** Proxies can’t protect your account if you violate Telegram’s rules. Telegram bans are behavior-based.

---

### Q: Can I use virtual numbers?
**A:** ✅ Yes. You can use virtual numbers, but make sure they’re from trusted providers. Telegram may flag some providers.

---

### Q: Are old accounts safer?
**A:** Yes. Older Telegram accounts are generally safer and more stable than newly created ones.

---

### Q: Will this tool guarantee that my accounts won’t be banned?
**A:** ❗ No. No tool can promise that. If you spam, mass DM, or violate Telegram's T&C, your account **will eventually get banned**, even if you use this tool.

---

### Q: Then what’s the benefit of this tool?
**A:** It uses advanced login logic, device emulation, and stealth methods to **delay detection** and make your accounts last longer.
